The Apple Vision annotated data set contains over 350 images of naturally growing apples on an apple tree. Unlike other existing sets, this set attempted to capture apples growing on trees with different exposures of natural light during the daytime.

The training data was comprised of 77 photos taken of Peter Bloch’s home apple tree. These images were shot between July and September of 2021 on an iPhone 11 camera. After the photos were taken, they were sliced into multiple smaller images with a resolution of 360 × 640 pixels per image. This number was selected as the lowest natural resolution for a CV camera later used in this project.

This set was originally created for the ECE 31 Capstone project at Oregon State University.
